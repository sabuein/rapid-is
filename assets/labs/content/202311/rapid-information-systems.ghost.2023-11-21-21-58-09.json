The energy efficiency is achieved through the installation of metering devices and billing based on consumption, which will decrease the use of energy and reduce consumer bills, and result in associated carbon emission savings. Metering also supports fair and transparent billing for customers on heat networks. In addition, the Regulations have led to the creation of the first database of UK heat networks.\n\nProducing accurate Entergy Bills for residents is a complex problem for a Local Authority. This is common, mainly because, there have been historical changes to who is responsible and what they are responsible for i.e., expenses, equipment buildings. There are also uplifts to bear in mind that anticipate future costs, and caps that control how much the weekly heat charge can change. Business and political decisions also get made that add complexity and to be included are unforeseen events like decants due to cladding-related concerns raised by Grenfell.\n\n\nSolution\n\nWorking alongside Camden Council, we developed several prototype solutions showing how data and digital transformation can promote collaboration, enable coordination, and deliver efficiency, cost saving and reduce carbon emissions.\n\nDue to the complexity and the amount of data that was involved in the project it was important that we were able to build the solution iteratively and ensure we worked closely with key stakeholders who lived and breathed the numbers.\n\nWe were able to build a solution that took last year’s costs to forecast the coming years charges on residents' bills. The solution is mostly used to take smart meter readings to determine residents' individual consumption and calculate the individual energy costs for their bill /statement.\n\n\nImpact\n\nAnnually the solution has led to a saving in 251 hours, which equates to FTE £.\n\nAs a Council it has built upon the culture of openness and transparency with residence, with residence able to view personalised bills and statements relating to energy consumption.\n\nImportantly the delivery of this solution has ensured that Camden is compliant inline with Metering and Billing Regulations and residents are a key beneficiary of this.\n\nProcessing the energy charge calculations in house keeps the standing charges significantly lower, when compared to the services being provided by an external supplier.  This keeps the costs lower for the residents which is extremely important given the costs of living crisis we are all in.  The bespoke system has been tailored to accommodate the variety of services that Camden supply to our residents, along with their different charging types.\nMary Harvey, Charges Controller at London Borough of Camden\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitePaper BestPracticestoMeasureLocationAccuracy 2020\nAdd optional file description\n\nWhitePaper_BestPracticestoMeasureLocationAccuracy_2020.pdf\n233 KB\n\n\n\ndownload-circle\n\n\n\n","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1527596615124-8b23ab91882f?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fENhbWRlbnxlbnwwfHx8fDE2OTkzNzA0MDF8MA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=2000","featured":1,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2023-11-07T15:12:47.000Z","updated_at":"2023-11-21T12:38:04.000Z","published_at":"2023-11-07T15:21:02.000Z","custom_excerpt":"Camden Council's innovative partnership delivers efficient energy billing, saving 251 hours annually, enhancing transparency, and ensuring regulatory compliance, benefiting both the council and residents alike.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"655cf1809bc97e1cde983e74","uuid":"d7aaa67b-e39a-4472-ac28-fd35c963efe2","title":"How to buy?","slug":"how-to-buy","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Buying frameworks – what are they and how do they work?\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"heading\",\"version\":1,\"tag\":\"h2\"},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Procuring technology and services can be a complex and lengthy undertaking, often involving significant time, cost and resource.

Moreover, local authorities face challenges in inspecting and monitoring temporary accommodation, as well as sharing data and best practice with each other.\n\nTo address these issues, the London Housing Directors’ Group, with the support of London Councils, commissioned the Setting the Standard (StS) programme in September 2020. The programme aims to ensure that all bed and breakfasts and studio flats used by local authorities for nightly paid temporary accommodation meet the required minimum quality standard. The programme also aims to improve the management of temporary accommodation and facilitate collaboration between local authorities.\n\nThe StS programme is delivered by the Commissioning Alliance, a partnership of 31 London boroughs led by the London Borough of Ealing. The Commissioning Alliance worked in partnership with us to develop a product that would solve this key challenge for all of London.\n\n\nSolution\n\nOur approach was to create a user-centred product that would meet the needs and requirements of all key stakeholders involved in the StS programme. These stakeholders included:\n\n * Placement officers, who are responsible for finding and booking temporary accommodation for homeless households.\n * Inspection officers, who are responsible for inspecting and reporting on the quality of temporary accommodation.\n * London Housing Directors, who are responsible for overseeing the delivery and performance of the StS programme.\n * Providers, who are responsible for managing and maintaining temporary accommodation.\n * Homeless households, who are the end-users of temporary accommodation.\n\nWe engaged with these stakeholders through workshops, interviews, surveys, and user-testing sessions to understand their pain points, expectations, and preferences. We also analysed the existing data and processes related to temporary accommodation in London.\n\nBased on our research, we designed and developed a product that would enable the following functions:\n\n * A centralised database of all temporary accommodation properties in London, with information on their quality, availability, location, and price\n * A standardised inspection framework and checklist, with a mobile app for inspection officers to conduct and record inspections.\n * A dashboard for placement officers to search and book temporary accommodation, with filters and ratings to help them find the most suitable properties.\n * A dashboard for London Housing Directors to monitor and evaluate the performance and impact of the StS programme, with indicators and reports to help them identify issues and opportunities.\n * A communication channel for providers to receive and respond to inspection results, feedback, and requests from local authorities.\n\nWe followed an agile methodology to deliver the product, with regular sprints and iterations based on user feedback and testing.\n\n\nImpact\n\nThe StS programme has been successfully implemented across London, with positive outcomes and impacts for both homeless households and local authorities. Some of the key results include:\n\nSTAT BLOCKS\n\nThe StS programme is a leading example of how pan-London collaboration can improve the quality of temporary accommodation for homeless households. The programme has enhanced the safety, security, and condition of temporary accommodation in London, and has improved the management and coordination of the temporary accommodation sector. The programme has also delivered key benefits for local authorities, such as reducing the cost and time of inspecting temporary accommodation, increasing the availability and choice of temporary accommodation, and ensuring that all homeless households in their area are receiving the standard of accommodation that they deserve.","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1689867373120-355ce130d485?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDEzfHxMb25kb24lMjdzJTIwaG91c2luZyUyMGxhbmRzY2FwZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE3MDAyNDEwNjR8MA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=2000","featured":1,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2023-11-17T17:03:35.000Z","updated_at":"2023-11-17T21:05:28.000Z","published_at":"2023-11-17T17:10:30.000Z","custom_excerpt":"Uncover the success story of the Setting the Standard (StS) programme — reshaping London's housing landscape.
