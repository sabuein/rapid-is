It's as simple as that.\n\nWe work closely with housing associations and social landlords to increase tenant satisfaction and improve service delivery in what is perhaps one of the most critical and emotive services you offer – repairs and maintenance.\n\nWe also specialise in working with contractors and subcontractors to help increase first-time fix rates and reduce no-access appointments.\n\nUltimately, everything we do is focused directly on improving the lives of people in social housing. Our software exists to positively impact your organisation and support you in improving your service delivery to tenants. And that is something we are extremely passionate about.","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1505778276668-26b3ff7af103?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fHB1cnBvc2V8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjk1Njc5OTEwfDA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=2000","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2023-09-19T20:59:19.000Z","updated_at":"2023-09-25T22:11:57.000Z","published_at":"2023-09-19T20:59:31.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"650a0bbd2cde8310eb4679e8","uuid":"ad2e301d-40d3-4785-b070-3319d21ee703","title":"Our promise","slug":"our-promise","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Our promise is to deliver a constantly beneficial partnership for our clients which means Rapid is the last service management software you need to invest in.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Trusted for over a decade by the housing community, we provide solutions that help social housing providers and contractors deliver the positive repairs and maintenance service that their tenants deserve and providers need.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"You're more likely to find us talking to residents or out with operatives than you are in exhibitions because for us, serving the housing sector isn’t just a job, it's a purpose.
